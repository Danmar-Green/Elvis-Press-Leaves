Elvis Press Leaves group project: Book Swap

Client: Maryum


Requirements from Client:
1. Users use an amount of points for each book they request from another user
    a. When a book trade is accepted, the point(s) gained from the transaction should not transfer over to the sending user until the user receiving the book has marked the book as received.
    b. Users should not be able to use points from books they have traded until the book they sent is marked received.
    c. If for some reason the book is never marked received your website can handle that by making a note of the issue and everyone should retain their original point values with no penalty. It may be a good idea to keep track of "never received books" in relationship to the sender and receiver to keep track of who may be attempting to abuse the system, having an automatic cutoff in place. Example: sent 5 books but 0 received and no history of previously received books might be a red flag.  Or having a ratio of sent books to received is another idea.
2. Users gain an amount of points for each book they trade
    a. If I offer a book up for trade and it's selected for me to send to another user then I should gain a point. However, the point(s) I gain should be held by the app until the book is marked as received by the user receiving the book.  This is to prevent users from gaming the system by agreeing to trade multiple books, never sending them but using the points they gained from the transaction to obtain more books from users.
    b. The amount of points gained per each trade is up to the developer.  YOu can make it elaborate, points are assigned based on edition, condition, etc., or more simplistic.
3. Users can accept a swap or reject a swap
    a. When a user receives a swap request from another user who wants their book they should have the ability to accept or reject this swap. This is useful in cases where the user may not want to swap books with a user (maybe that user has a habit of never marking books received, maybe the user who would send the book is low on cash and will not be able to pay for shipping)
4. Users can log in and log out
    a. This can mean that the login data is handled directly by your website or you can use third party authentication
    b. Users should have a way to privately store their address, password, and other logn information you determine is necessary for the site to function.
    c. There should also be a way for users to update password and other vital account information.
5. Users can post books they want to trade to other users
    a. I envision that when I click on a user, I can navigate to a list of other books they have available for swap. This will be beneficial for those receiving the books (they can request multiple books from one user and receive them at the same time, and for the user sending the books as they will have one combined shipping cost which will likely be lower)

Optional Additional Features from Client:
1. Users can post a wishlist of books they want
2. Users can post descriptions of books: good condition, poor, acceptable, excellent, etc.
3. If a user accepts a swap, then they receive an address to ship the book to
4. There should be a way to sort for available books to request by category (ex. scifi, adventure)
5. Total books requested by a user are available on each account
6. Total books given by a user are available on account
7. There should be a way to mark a book as never received after a set number of days
8. There should be a way to designate a book that was received in poor condition. And request your points back
9. Create an area for users to post requests for books they can't remember the name of or want suggestions. (ex. I am looking for a fantasy book about fairies that ride squirrels)
10. When a user looks through the books available to request, they should be able to see how many copies are available (and different conditions for copies available)
