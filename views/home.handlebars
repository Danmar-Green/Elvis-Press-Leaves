<p>Build a bookshelf of books to trade to other users in exchange for points that you can use to get more books!</p>
<p>The only cost is shipping when you're sending a book.</p>
<p>It's completely up to you whether you keep the book you receive or if you put it up for trading after you're done.
   Every user gets a few points to get them started and then you get more when you've successfully traded a book.
